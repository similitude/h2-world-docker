H2 World DB Docker Base Image
=============================

A Docker base image for the World sample database in the H2 DBMS.

World is a sample relational database created for [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/world-setup/en/)
and ported to [PostgreSQL](http://pgfoundry.org/frs/?group_id=1000150&release_id=366#world-world-1.0-title-content).
This data was exported from a PostgreSQL database with `INSERT` statements and
cleaned up manually for compatibility with H2.

> * Very fast, open source, JDBC API
> * Embedded and server modes; in-memory databases
> * Browser based Console application
